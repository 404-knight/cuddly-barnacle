## Keylogger
This is a simple program implemented in C.
It is supposed to log all keys pressed(event7-input)

The program, as long as you are on your terminal works(it doesn't output what you input from your browser; not a great keylogger yet, right?)

To use it, run with sudo priviledges as follows:
<bash> sudo ./keylogger dev/input/event7
